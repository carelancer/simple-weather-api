Thank you for taking the time to interivew at Carelancer. 

We value your time and effort so we have streamlined this tech challange. 

For this challenge, you need to use an existing API response from the open weather map API to create a simple, yet visually appealing and functional UI (in Vue 3 preferrably) to show the user some weather data. 

What you show, how you show it, is up to you. 

Here is the sample response: 

{"coord":{"lon":-79.4163,"lat":43.7001},"weather":[{"id":501,"main":"Rain","description":"moderate rain","icon":"10d"}],"base":"stations","main":{"temp":33.58,"feels_like":20.98,"temp_min":32.5,"temp_max":34.52,"pressure":989,"humidity":96,"sea_level":989,"grnd_level":973},"visibility":10000,"wind":{"speed":28.01,"deg":210,"gust":37},"rain":{"1h":2.29},"clouds":{"all":100},"dt":1765388698,"sys":{"type":2,"id":2099289,"country":"CA","sunrise":1765370445,"sunset":1765402841},"timezone":-18000,"id":6167865,"name":"Toronto","cod":200}

1) Create a new Vue project
2) Your widget should the temperate, 'feels like' temperature

    *  You do not need to code an remote call to the server to fetch data. 
    * You can use this response as the data from the server. 
    * Focus only on the Vue code, layout, UI/UX aspects of this challenge. 
    * Do not spend more than 2-3 hours on it. You really shouldhn't have to. 
    * Do use any libaries, frameworks, etc you are comfortable. Please leave some comments on why you chose those libaries/frameworks,etc 
    * Nearly everyone is using some sort of Coding Augment tool. Pleease avoid using one for this challenge. If you do use one, please call out the sections of your code where you used and why. For the live port of the interview, we will ask you not to use any augement tools.
