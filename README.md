Thank you for takign the time to interivew at Carelancer. 

We value your time and effort so we have streamlined this tech challange. 

For this challenge, you need to use an existing API response from the open weather map API to create a simple, yet visually appealing and functional UI (in Vue 3 preferrably) to show the user some weather data. 

What you show, how you show it, is up to you. 

Here is the sample response: 

{"coord":{"lon":-79.4163,"lat":43.7001},"weather":[{"id":501,"main":"Rain","description":"moderate rain","icon":"10d"}],"base":"stations","main":{"temp":33.58,"feels_like":20.98,"temp_min":32.5,"temp_max":34.52,"pressure":989,"humidity":96,"sea_level":989,"grnd_level":973},"visibility":10000,"wind":{"speed":28.01,"deg":210,"gust":37},"rain":{"1h":2.29},"clouds":{"all":100},"dt":1765388698,"sys":{"type":2,"id":2099289,"country":"CA","sunrise":1765370445,"sunset":1765402841},"timezone":-18000,"id":6167865,"name":"Toronto","cod":200}
